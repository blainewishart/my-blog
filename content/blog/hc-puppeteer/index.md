Because Blaine is currently in China and I am in Berkeley, we have been slacking on our daily Zoom meetings. However, we were finally able to coordinate a time today! Woo! Without fail these meetings seem to result in an interesting discussion of new tools we can use to accellerate our learning and deepen our curiosity of modern software.

<h3>Today we discussed two tools:</h3>

1. Google's automated testing tool [Headless Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome)
is a way to automatically test server environments without a user interface. <br>

Here is a list of possible [use cases](https://github.com/checkly/puppeteer-examples).

1. [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) which can be used to drive Headless Chrome.

<h3>Thoughts:</h3>

1. Use [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) (an open-source automated tool that will help improve your webpage by auditing performance, accessibility, etc.) to gather intial data on the restaurant website I recently built. 
2. Then see how Puppeteer and Headless Chrome could be integrated to gather more in depth data.
