## how to blog
1. startusing dropbox/dev-notes/daily for daily record as origin for everything not in slack -- private by default. I'll need to copy *.md to My Blog
1. set up channel in Slack for posts, in addition to post ideas
    1. gatsby has a [source plugin],(https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-slack-users/)
    1. I think this gives optimal combination of the easy of using slack with a regular trace.
    1. with a little luck, we may see how to use a slack filter to get material from acroos channels
    1. probably want to insert front matter and leave it out of slack entry
1. get the elm library working for layout and format
    1. [elm-ui](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-ui has instructions, reference to video, and example)
1. [Alex Korban](https://korban.net/posts/elm/2018-11-17-elm-ui-introduction/) has a tutorial
1. [Matthew Griffith has a video which introduces the idea of palettes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie-gqwSHQr0&t=2s)
### the path for November
* use ghjost/contours for public stuff
* use My Blog to share with Taylor
* use Alex Korban's tutorial on an Elm version of Slack at the real path forward. Limit features to add/edit/delete and begin with fixed chaannels. Later make the entries mdx
